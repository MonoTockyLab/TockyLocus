# Introduction

Fluorescent Timer proteins uniquely change their emission spectra over time and serve as powerful tools for monitoring the dynamic processes within cells. Our recent efforts have successfully implemented data preprocessing methods in the **TockyPrep** package. However, it is still challenging to analyze Timer fluorescence dynamics and apply quantitative and statistical analysis methods. To overcome these challenges, the **TockyLocus** package has been developed. This R package provides quantitative analysis methods, statistical methods, and visualization techniques dedicated for Timer fluorescence data analysis.

## Aim

The aim of the **TockyLocus** package is to standardize quantitative analysis and visualization techniques for flow cytometric Fluorescent Timer data. It focuses on data categorization using Timer Angle data, which represents the temporal maturation dynamics of Timer proteins.

## Relationship to the package TockyPrep

The **TockyPrep** package facilitates data preprocessing for flow cytometric Fluorescent Timer data. The **TockyLocus** package utilizes this preprocessed data to apply its advanced quantitative and visualization methods.

## Getting Started with **TockyLocus**

To begin using **TockyLocus**, install both TockyLocus and TockyPrep packages from GitHub:

```R
# Install TockyPrep and TockyLocus from GitHub
devtools::install_github("MonoTockyLab/TockyPrep")
devtools::install_github("MonoTockyLab/TockyLocus")

```


# Sample Workflow

This section guides you through a typical analysis workflow using **TockyLocus** to process flow cytometric data of cells expressing Fluorescent Timer proteins, covering data import, preprocessing application, and basic visualization techniques.

## Data Preprocessing Using **TockyPrep**

First, load the necessary packages.

```{r tockyprep, include=TRUE}
library(TockyPrep)
library(TockyLocus)
```

Load example data included in the TockyLocus package as follows:

```{r files, include=TRUE}
# Example data load
# Define the base path
file_path <- system.file("extdata", package = "TockyLocus")

# Define files
negfile <- "Timer_negative.csv"
samplefiles <- list.files(file_path, pattern = "sample_", full.names = FALSE)
samplefiles <- setdiff(samplefiles, file.path(file_path, negfile))
```

The dataset was derived from Nr4a3 Tocky T-cells. Briefly, T-cells from Nr4a3 Tocky T cells were activated by antigen stimulation using the ova/ OT-II system, and time course analysis was performed (@Bending2018JCB).

| Group | Time (h) | Treatment                          |
|-------|----------|------------------------------------|
| 0     | 0        | Stimulation from 0h                |
| 4     | 4        | Stimulation from 0h                |
| 8     | 8        | Stimulation from 0h                |
| 12    | 12       | Stimulation from 0h                |
| 16    | 16       | Stimulation from 0h                |
| 24    | 24       | Stimulation from 0h                |
| 32    | 32       | Stimulation from 0h                |
| 48    | 48       | Stimulation from 0h                |
| 32.aMHC  | 32       | Stim. till 24h, then suspended     |
| 48.aMHC  | 48       | Stim. till 24h, then suspended     |




### Execute data preprocessing using **TockyPrep**:


![](assets/TockyPrep.png){width=50% align="center"} 

Define sample and negative control files using the `prep_tocky` function

```{r prep, include=TRUE}
# Preprocessing data
prep <- prep_tocky(path = file_path, samplefile = samplefiles, negfile = negfile, interactive = FALSE)
```

The function `timer_transform` not only imports data but also normalize and transform Timer blue and red fluorescence data.

```{r timer_transform, include=TRUE}
# Normalizing and transforming data
x <- timer_transform(prep, blue_channel = 'Timer.Blue', red_channel = 'Timer.Red', select = FALSE, verbose = FALSE)
```

Check the class of the transformed object:

```{r class, include=TRUE}
class(x)
```

To effectively visualize the processed data, define sample grouping using the function `sample_definition`. 

The example file `sampledefinition.csv` provides the standard form. Use read.csv to create a data.frame onject, which can be used as input into `sample_definition`.

```{r sample_definition1, include = TRUE}
sample_definition <- read.csv(file.path(file_path, 'sampledef.csv'))
sample_definition <- as.data.frame(sample_definition)
head(sample_definition)
# Normalizing and transforming data

x <- sample_definition(x, sample_definition = sample_definition, interactive = FALSE)

```

Alternatively, define sample grouping for effective visualization by using the `sample_definition` function with the `interactive = TRUE` option. This approach will generate a CSV file in your working directory. You should edit this CSV file to include sample grouping information in the `group` column. After editing, follow the prompts in the interactive session and press `RETURN` upon completion.

```{r sample_definition_alternative, include=FALSE}
#x <- sample_definition(x, output_dir = 'outuput', interactive = TRUE)

```

Visualize the processed data with a density plot using the function `plotAngleDensity`.

```{r plotAngleDensity, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
# Visualizing the results
plotAngleDensity(x)
```

The `plotAngleDensity` function offers preliminary insights into the dynamics of Timer fluorescence. However, this visualization method has certain limitations that will be discussed in subsequent sections.

 
## Tocky Locus Analysis

Use the `TockyLocus` function to apply the Tocky Locus approach to your data:

```{r TockyLocus, include=TRUE}
x <- TockyLocus(x)

```

The `TockyLocus` function categorizes Timer Angle data into five categories. To visually represent these categories, the `plotTockyLocusLegend` function can be used to produce a schematic figure of the five Tocky Locus categories.



```{r PlotTockyLocusLegend, fig.width=5, fig.height=2, include=TRUE}
plotTockyLocusLegend(mar_par = c(2, 2, 4, 2))

```


For quality checks of the Tocky Locus categorization, use the `plot_tocky_locus` function. The option `n = 4` specifies the number of columns in the multi-panel plot.


## plot_tocky_locus: The QC plot for TockyLocus
```{r plot_tocky_locus, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, include=TRUE}
plot_tocky_locus(x, n = 4)

```

Note that the sample at 0 hours, taken before antigen stimulation, shows some pure red fluorescence. This phenomenon is due to the memory phenotype T-cells accumulated in vivo in OT-II Nr4a3 Tocky mice. These memory phenotype T-cells are considered self-reactive and can develop in OT-II Nr4a3 Tocky mice as the Rag genes are sufficiently expressed (@OnoSatou2024).

## plotTockyLocus: The Plot Function for TockyLocus
To visualize the Timer Angle dynamics per Tocky Locus, use the `plotTockyLocus` function. The default 'faceted' plot produces multiple panels for different groups. Note that the percentage data are based on the percentages within the parent population, which in this dataset, is CD4+ T cells.


```{r PlotTockyLocus, fig.width=8, fig.height=4, include=TRUE}
plotTockyLocus(x, verbose = FALSE)

```

If you prefer not to use faceting, employ the `group_by = FALSE` option to generate a Tocky Locus plot without multiple panels.

```{r PlotTockyLocus_Locus, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, include=TRUE}
plotTockyLocus(x, group_by = FALSE,  verbose = FALSE)

```
